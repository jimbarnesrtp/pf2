Lost Omens Character Guide pg. 71 The Firebrands use a variety of unorthodox equipment and techniques to achieve their goals, whether those goals include drawing attention, or subterfuge and subtlety. The following Firebrand options are uncommon, and members of the Firebrands gain access to them once they reach the rank of second mark. The  Entourage  feat is rare even for members of the Firebrands, as it requires a certain degree of fame and in-world activity to acquire, and potentially requires the player or GM to keep track of additional background NPCs. Typically, only third mark and fourth mark Firebrands have the notoriety and social influence required to maintain an entourage. While Firebrands seek to build an entourage more than most adventurers, it\u2019s not unreasonable for any famous character to gain access to it if the players are interested in playing with the  Entourage  feat. :  , "

You\u2019re a prepared spellcaster, able to prepare two cantrips and one 1st-level spell each day. You prepare these spells from a Red Mantis assassin spellbook, similar to a wizard\u2019s, containing three cantrips and two 1st-level spells. All the spells in your Red Mantis assassin spellbook, from this and later feats, must be either transmutation or illusion spells from the arcane spell list or a spell from the following list: clairaudience , clairvoyance , darkness , dimension door , modify memory , obscuring mist , paralyze , see invisibility , true strike . Regardless of their usual magical tradition, your Red Mantis assassin spells are divine spells, as are any Red Mantis focus spells you gain. You can prepare two cantrips and one 1st-level spell each day from those found in your Red Mantis assassin spellbook. You\u2019re trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for casting divine spells. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.",

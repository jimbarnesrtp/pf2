Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.", "Critical Success The target is unaffected.", "Success The target takes a -2 status penalty to Deception checks.", "Failure The target can\u2019t speak any deliberate and intentional lies, and it takes a -2 status penalty to Deception checks.", "Critical Failure The target can\u2019t speak any deliberate and intentional lies and takes a -4 status penalty to Deception checks."]

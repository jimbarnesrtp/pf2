Your GM might adjust the price and DC depending on the token's material and quality and the religious significance of the site; the more significant the location, the easier the attunement.",

You learn only that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it's suspicious. For example, if you entered a study with a large bloodstain on the ground, the bloodstain is so obviously suspicious it's evident to you already, so the GM might note that there's something suspicious about the desk drawer instead. You would then need to investigate the drawer further to find out what specifically is out of the ordinary. That's Odd doesn't reveal whether creatures are suspicious.  You don't typically get any benefit when you leave and come back to a place, though if a major change has happened there and time has passed, the GM might determine that you do.",

Desert (fire) The scorching heat of the desert dehydrates your foes. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, they're fatigued until they drink water or another potable liquid. Forest (plant) Branches and vines reach out to get in your foes' way. Enemies must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, they become clumsy 1 for 1 round (clumsy 2 on a critical failure). Mountain (earth) The rugged endurance of the mountain protects you from harm. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to the spell level for 1 round. Plains (plant) The growing fields and pulsing vitality of the plains provide you vigor. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level for 1 round. Sky (air) A gust of wind carries you aloft. You can Fly up to 10 feet. If you're in the air at the end of the turn and don't have a fly Speed, you fall. Swamp (plant) Your magic draws in noxious swamp gas to fumigate your foes. Affected foes take persistent poison damage equal to half the spell's level (minimum 1 damage) with a basic Fortitude save. Underground (earth) The endless darkness of the cavern depths opens up its secrets to your senses. For 1 round, you gain darkvision as well as imprecise tremorsense out to 15 feet.

Advanced Player's Guide pg. 56  once per 10 minutes You spend 1 minute examining the details of one potential clue, designating the subject related to that clue as the target of your active investigation. This subject is typically a single creature, item, or small location (such as a room or corridor), but the GM might allow a different scope for your investigation. You don't need to know the identity, purpose, or nature of the subject, but you do need to be aware of its existence. For instance, finding a footprint is enough to investigate the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject.  Whenever you attempt a Perception or skill check to investigate a designated subject, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks this applies to depend on the actions you use to investigate and are determined by the GM, but checks to investigate are typically Perception checks or skill checks that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.  You can maintain two active investigations at a time. If you Pursue another Lead after that, the subject must be different from any of your current investigations (or rather, they must be different as far as you know), and you give up on a current subject of your choice.

Your bond may be tenuous, but that doesn't make your connection any less special. You gain an  eidolon  as well as the Manifest Eidolon activity. Due to your tenuous link, you can't gain or use  tandem  actions. Because you don't have  Act Together , only you or your eidolon can perform an exploration activity at one time, so for instance you couldn't both be  Searching  or  Investigating .  Your eidolon is trained in  unarmed  attacks and unarmored defense, and shares your proficiency rank for Perception, saving throws, and skill checks. Choose an eidolon type. You become trained in your eidolon's listed skills. For each of those skills that you are already trained in, you become trained in a different skill of your choice. Your eidolon's initial ability scores are reduced. It starts with a 16 in any ability score listed at 18 for its eidolon array. It otherwise gains the statistics listed for an eidolon of that type.  At 5th level, the eidolon's ability score that was reduced to 16 increases to 18, before applying ability boosts. At levels 5, 10, 15, and 20, your eidolon also gets four ability boosts, which follow the same rules as yours.   Secrets of Magic pg. 52 Your eidolon appears in an open space adjacent to you, and can then take a single action. If your eidolon was already manifested, you unmanifest it instead.  The conduit that allows your eidolon to manifest is also a tether between you. Your eidolon must remain within 100 feet of you at all times and can't willingly go beyond that limit. If forced beyond this distance, or if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your eidolon's physical form dissolves: your eidolon unmanifests, and you need to use Manifest Eidolon to manifest it again.  This activity has the trait matching your eidolon's tradition ( arcane ,  divine ,  occult , or  primal ).\n  You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the summoner archetype.",

                "text": "You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment, and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a  Seek  action to attempt a Perception check against your  Deception  DC, as if you were using the  Impersonate  action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity\u2014a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.  Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.  Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to  Recall Knowledge  about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the  detect alignment  spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.  To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits:  social  or  vigilante . You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.  You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vigilante archetype.",

A possessor can use any of the target\u2019s abilities that are purely physical, and it can\u2019t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities.

A possessor uses the target\u2019s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor\u2019s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target\u2019s invested items apply when using the target\u2019s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn\u2019t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body.

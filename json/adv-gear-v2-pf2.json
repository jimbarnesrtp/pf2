When worn with a breastplate, chain shirt, chain mail, or scale mail, an armored skirt increases the armor\u2019s item bonus to AC by 1, worsens the armor\u2019s check penalty by 1, reduces the armor\u2019s Dex cap by 1, increases the Strength score required to ignore the check penalty and reduce the Speed penalty by 2, and adds the noisy trait. This also makes the armor one step heavier (from light to medium, or medium to heavy), and you use the proficiency bonus appropriate to this adjusted armor type. Alternatively, when wearing an armored skirt to replace appropriate portions of a set of half plate or full plate, reduce the armor\u2019s item bonus to AC by 1, lessen the check penalty by 1, decrease the Strength score required to ignore the check penalty and reduce the Speed penalty by 2, increase the armor\u2019s Dex cap by 1, and add the noisy trait to the armor.

The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb\u2019s damage type in addition to the crossbow\u2019s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb\u2019s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb\u2019s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on).

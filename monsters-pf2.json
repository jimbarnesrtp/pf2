The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can\u2019t move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma. Wherever the sphere travels, it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain (the pleroma\u2019s choice of normal, difficult, or greater difficult terrain) or a 5-foot-square solid barrier of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood, or stone). The sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM\u2019s choice away from the sphere. Those who fail take 20d6 Positive damage (even if they are living) and are pushed away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage from a failure, become one with the new material and can be restored only via a 10th-level spell.

Once manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged attack, but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved. Any unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed. Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact. The sphere can enter the space of a creature, with effects similar to the Sphere of Creation except that it deals negative damage (even to undead) on a failure and annihilates rather than incorporating the creature into material.

Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying \u201d as slow as a well-fed basilisk.\u00c2\u0094 Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed.", "An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to a guttural gurgle when they\u2019re agitated. Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.", "For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk\u2019s stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk\u2019s blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.", "Basilisks can be found in almost any terrestrial environment, including forests, hills, mountains, plains, and swamps. They tend to dwell in caves or sheltered areas, and their hides often bear complexions that allow them to more easily blend with their environments. As a result, forestdwelling basilisks may have scales of a verdant emerald color to match surrounding vegetation, while a basilisk that lives in the desert may be a sandy brown or shale color."]

Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven\u2019t been properly tended to.", "Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren\u2019t hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal tools to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshipers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been blessed by the village\u2019s hungry god.", "Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.", "Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.", "A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it flies off to digest its meal.", "Bloodseekers hunt close to their nests, which they make in fens, bogs, fetid pools, and abandoned buildings. A foot-wide amalgamation of mud and reeds is a telltale sign of a bloodseeker nest.", "Bloodseekers have no interest in treasure, but their lairs tend to be scattered with the remains of adventurers\u00e2\u0080\u0094and their valuables."]

The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.", "The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf\u00e2\u0080\u0094a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette\u2019s path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.", "Although bulettes will eat almost any living creature that they can catch within their vicious jaws, most of them have a particular fondness for the flesh of halflings or horses. Lacking other food, a bulette might gnaw upon vegetable matter or even inanimate objects, although they don\u2019t gain actual nourishment from doing so, this need to feed being merely an extension of a deeply compelling instinct."]

For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.", "In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.", "Bunyips have no use for treasure, and do not actively collect it, but the floors of their lairs are sometimes littered with the possessions of their humanoid victims. A bunyip\u2019s teeth can be collected and sold (most bunyips have about 50 teeth at any one time). Alternatively, due to their elusiveness and fabled nature, a high-quality taxidermic bunyip could easily command a high price from a collector."]

They can even understand a few rudimentary words in Sylvan, although they are incapable of clearly speaking themselves.", "This doesn\u2019t stop the cauthooj from attempting to mimic the sounds it hears, but when it does so, its eerie primal nature enhances the attempt, leading to the bird\u2019s signature ability to manipulate minds and encourage conflict, a trait the cauthooj is just barely smart enough to understand\u00e2\u0080\u0094and enjoy.", "Like magpies, cauthoojs are attracted to shiny baubles, and they often pick up choice treasures from their victims, depositing these trinkets in large piles in their lairs. Not all that glitters is gold, however, and adventurers will find as many colorful bits of string, broken mirror shards, and pieces of costume jewelry as they find coins, magic weapons, and other valuable treasures.", "Cauthoojs make their lairs in small caverns, alcoves, and similar out-of-the-way places, but claim large stretches of territory and wander many miles from their lairs in search of food.

More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life.", "Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of a true demon lord."]

Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to pursue their specialties.

These fearsome creatures enjoy being considered as dangerous as storms or natural disasters by seafaring folk. Dragon turtles delight in amassing treasure, although most prefer to receive tribute from passing sailors and often store their hoards in the shipwrecks of vessels once crewed by those unwilling to surrender their valuables. Dragon turtles are solitary creatures and hunt in regions encompassing a hundred square miles or more. Although they normally eat large fish, they are omnivorous and also eat seaweed or even foolhardy dragon hunters. Experienced sailors keep a keen eye out for dragon turtles, preparing to flee should one approach or offer it treasure in exchange for safe passage.", "Most dragon turtles are at least 20 feet wide and 50 feet long, although some can grow substantially larger. These massive, ancient dragon turtles are somnolent, and resemble rocky islands from a distance; their prodigious hoards can be a source of truly ancient sea lore. Legends persist of truly immense dragon turtles who spend centuries drifting on the surface of the ocean, far from established shipping lanes or charted waters, with shells that serve as islands capable of supporting entire ecosystems and even, some claim, small settlements whose inhabitants know nothing of land that doesn\u2019t drift across the sea.", "Dragon turtles keep their treasure in shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean. Their hoards usually contain coins, jewelry, and magic items that can survive lengthy submersion.", "Although most dragon turtles hunt in the open ocean, some live along coastlines or even within large inland lakes."],

When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal.", "The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. of course, the drakauthix isn\u2019t above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.", "Duergars hunt drakauthixes for their flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean races also make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding and pressing the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.", "When a new drakauthix bursts forth from a spore-infested corpse, it has no true way of defending itself. However, a sporeling does not need to hunt until it grows much larger. Each sporeling harvests enough material from the body it emerged from to grow to its full size over a few short days.

Like many house cats, elananxes are not content to merely track and devour prey, but prefer to toy with their victims, drawing joy and excitement from the fear and pain of those they capture. To this end, elananxes rarely use their cinder dispersal ability to evade their targets, instead opting to foil their quarry just before the end of the hunt\u00e2\u0080\u0094though, as selfish creatures who wish to live to hunt again, elananxes often reserve one use of this ability, just in case.", "Because of their clever and malicious ways, elananxes are favored as hunting companions by redcaps, who go out of their way to befriend or make deals with these creatures. Redcaps also find great sport in hunts where competing elananxes chase a single creature.

Because they are immune to the damage caused by flickering flames, they enjoy capering and caterwauling through the smoky, burning ruins of forest infernos. Some have even been known to use their burning bites to deliberately Light undergrowth on fire, simply so they might experience the beauty of the flames combined with the inevitable pain such disasters inflict on other creatures."]

Such mounts are known for their strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals and possess a wisdom not normally afforded most animals; it is thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry a rider in flight is a long and expensive ordeal.

Silent as the grave and as inevitable as time itself, this legendary being hunts down and finishes creatures that have evaded death for far too long. Sometimes the Grim Reaper comes without warning, while at others it comes to finish the work that other creatures could not. The Grim Reaper serves no god, fiend, or aeon. It is both despised and feared by psychopomps and celestials, but few\u00e2\u0080\u0094if any\u00e2\u0080\u0094dare to stand in its way. Like some eternal plague, it kills those who try to cure the multiverse of its presence. It stands alone and holds only its own council, and the pleading and reasoning of mortals and immortals alike fall on deaf ears once the Grim Reaper closes on its quarry. Its own reasoning is Silent to mortal ears and inscrutable to the mortal mind, but no matter the reason, the result is unyielding and final.", "While some legends hold that the Grim Reaper appears before everyone as they die, the truth is quite a bit more disturbing. Such vigils in fact lie within the providence of the psychopomps, a race of immortals charged with the protection and guidance of mortal souls through the afterlife. The Grim Reaper has little interest in protecting souls or guiding them. It is instead compelled by sinister agendas arising within the nighted realm of Abaddon, where the Horsemen of the Apocalypse rule. Indeed there are many similarities in shape and form between the Grim Reaper and Charon, the Horseman of Death, but no recorded instance exists of these two powerful entities working together. Instead, the Grim Reaper serves as something of a manifestation of Abaddon itself, and in this regard is believed by some to be an incarnation of the mysterious First Horseman. When the Grim Reaper comes to a world, it does so not as an angel of mercy, but as a relentless harvester of life. Those who fall to the Grim Reaper were not destined to die as much as they were selected, hunted, and murdered.", "Perhaps the most frightening legends surrounding the Grim Reaper concern its nature as a singular entity, for some believe that more than one grim reaper exists in the Great Beyond. These whispers tell of a cabal of at least nine of these creatures that stalk reality, culling the living as inexplicable servants of true entropy. According to the teaching of some death cults, the final goal of the Grim Reaper is to end the entire cycle of life and death and serve as a Silent lord of an empty universe.", "The grim reaper keeps no treasure, but sometimes lesser deaths hang on to strange keepsakes from those whom they have slain\u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially in cases where a lesser death has set its unholy sight on an extended family or faction."]

This doesn\u2019t result in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to speak. Over time, a few of these \u201d awakened\u00c2\u0094 homunculi even go so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator\u2019s class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit.", "Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and a pint of the creator\u2019s own blood.

Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in an orgiastic frenzy that can last for an entire day and night. After the mating has finished, the females slay their mate and devour his nutrient-rich flesh, and his organs in particular. These organs contain a unique chemical compound vital to gestation. Many naturalists will pay handsomely for the fresh remains of a male krooth so they can study the strange properties of the creature\u2019s blood and organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous, hollow teeth. When these creatures bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes the victim to bleed profusely as their blood pours through the hollow tooth.", "Whether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid flesh, especially that of bugbears.

Most lamias are humanoid from the waist up but have the lower bodies of beasts and monsters. Sinister magic comes naturally to a lamia, and they prefer the use of illusions and enchantments to deceive prey for later consumption, or simply to torture.", "Just as they were cursed long ago, lamias can curse those they touch, clouding the mind and regressing conscious thought to purely animalistic instincts. Creatures affected by this curse grow reckless, becoming unaware of the consequences of their own actions and unable to think clearly. This makes the hapless victim all the more susceptible to the lamia\u2019s cunning illusions and insidious charms. The lamia\u2019s animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch has led some scholars to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned away from their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts. Whether this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from Mother of Demons or inflicted as a curse for abandoning their responsibilities by The Lady of Graves remains the subject of debate to this day.", "Whatever the source of this ancient transformation, lamias themselves have grown to enjoy the strengths it has granted them. Regardless, they continue to cling to a hatred of the gods, seeing them as the cause of their monstrous forms and, thus, their eternal exile from the societies they watch with jealous eyes from their lairs amid the ruins of lost civilizations. Because lamias blame divine powers for their curse, they take special delight in the downfall of temples, the suffering and death of champions and clerics, and the spread of dissension within organized religions.", "While they can briefly assume humanoid form with magic, lamias are usually forced to hide from civilization, making their homes in the barren wilderness. There, they attract cults of their own, gathering up chaotic and evil humanoids. With the help of these cultists, lamias strive to bring down popular faiths, introduce schisms into flourishing churches, and humiliate or defame high-profile religious leaders. Most lamias themselves have no true religious faith in anything, hearing instead a mystical calling that manifests as sighs on the desert wind or murmurs from the dark places between the stars.", "Lamias are traditionally matriarchal, revering the eldest female among them as leader, mother, and shaman."]

While it\u2019s certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead\u00e2\u0080\u0094the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.", "Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone\u00e2\u0080\u0094they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live.

More often than not, these despicable manipulators wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving onto the next victim.", "Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant dimension beyond dreams\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars and dimensional travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of this mysterious connection, but they have yet to decipher the truth.

According to the legend, the wizard was too successful and ended up being the first victim of the beast. Today, owlbears can be found around the world, with a variety of features. While the most common subspecies looks like a brown bear with the features of a great horned owl, owlbears from the frozen north might resemble polar bears mixed with snowy owls, and in temperate rain forests they might resemble black bears with the heads of barn owls.", "Most owlbears live solitary lives, gathering only to mate and raise cubs, which are hatched from eggs. An owlbear\u2019s territory usually extends to around 5 miles from its lair, with clear signs of its habitat appearing with 1 mile (clawed up trees, gigantic feathers, and shredded carcasses). The lair of an owlbear rarely holds anything of value, but some adventurers have found trinkets, coins, and even jewelry in the massive pellets of undigested bones these monsters leave behind.", "Snowy owlbears trade their terrifying screech for amazing stealth and the learned ability to erupt from the snow to take prey by surprise. Although incredibly rare, some owlbears have retained a limited form of flight, allowing them to glide almost 20 feet for every foot of height descended.", "Terrifyingly, these gliding owlbears are entirely Silent while descending on their prey."]

Their territories span vast swaths of the wood, making them ideal allies for hunters or treasure seekers who would otherwise become lost in the dense trees. But porachas are nothing if not fickle, and typically demand inscrutable favors in return for their aid, such as the planting of a rare sapling in a particular grotto or the clearing of an invasive monster species around a treasured spring. Any attempt to coerce or trick a poracha into service is ill advised, for these sacred beasts have many friends among the kami as well as others of their kind.", "Though they generally don\u2019t travel in groups, porachas know where to find more of their kind in times of need, and an organized pack of porachas is a disorienting threat.", "Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves.", "When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature.

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don\u2019t have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \u201d shambling mounds,\u00c2\u0094 these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won\u2019t do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.", "Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for\u00e2\u0080\u0094or perhaps to summon\u00e2\u0080\u0094intense Lightning strikes.", "Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by Lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected (and powerful) elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.", "Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as \u201d spore mounds,\u00c2\u0094 discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and inflict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks."]

With their abnormally gaunt frames, long white hair, and unnerving, four-fingered hands, shining children are both strangely familiar and otherworldly in appearance, though they are barely visible within the shroud of blinding Light they continually emit. Their faces are truly horrible, however, as their overlarge eyes and distended, gaping mouths reveal their heads to be voids filled with unnatural Light. Shining children use this Light as a weapon, weaving illusions and focusing beams of fiery brilliance.", "Because of their reputation as scholars of the alien and the eldritch, shining children are sometimes summoned by powerful wizards or occultists in search of rare knowledge. The creatures never give away their lore without some price, though, and typically demand in return the performance of contemptible deeds that further their inscrutable, far-ranging plans.", "These mysterious beings are natives of the Astral Plane. In that vast plane, accretions of metaphysical matter gradually accumulate and eventually coalesce into demiplanes. During this tumultuous process, sparks of living Light sometimes shear off the newly formed planes, and these sparks of raw planar energy somehow transform into shining children. Every newly formed demiplane leaves a different mental imprint on its shining \u201d offspring,\u00c2\u0094 making it easy for shining children to telepathically recognize their brothers and sisters. Forever trapped in apparently adolescent bodies, shining children dedicate themselves to scholarship and violence with equal measure in a futile effort to understand their roles in the multiverse and the burning injustice of their births.", "Shining children confuse most other creatures with their refusal to use individual names in favor of alternating between referring to each other singularly and collectively."]

They rely on tiny sensory whiskers that cover their snout and allow them to detect subtle movements in the air and ground without the use of vision. When it detects suitable prey, a shuln bites the target at the first opportunity, injecting it with a potent paralytic toxin present in its saliva. So strong is this poison that it is capable of subduing even the near-unstoppable purple worm, making the shuln a valuable (if dangerous) companion to have for anyone making excursions into worm-infested regions of the underworld.", "Shulns\u2019 notoriously ill-tempered dispositions and their knack for digging into areas of an underground settlement where digging ought not occur makes them frustrating creatures to keep around, but when the alternative is an unpredictable but deadly visit from an enormous, hungry cave worm, the annoyances are well worth the trouble.", "Encounters with much larger shuln-like entities on the Plane of Earth suggest that these creatures may have originated from that place.

Glands along the slurk\u2019s ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests between meals.", "Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals.

While other creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians, kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks.

As a result, tengus tend to gather in close-knit social groups composed of other outcasts and people of uncommon ancestry. Few true tengu communities exist, and those that do are often exiled to ghettos and other forgotten city quarters. From an early age, tengus learn that the world is not a friendly place and that they must look out for themselves."]
